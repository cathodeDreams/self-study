# Elementary Mathematics and LaTeX: A Self-Study System

## Prerequisites

1. A computer with VS Code installed
2. Basic familiarity with command-line operations
3. Willingness to learn and practice regularly

## Setup

Install the following:

1. VS Code extensions:
   - LaTeX Workshop
   - Math Snippet

2. LaTeX distribution:
   - Windows: MiKTeX
   - macOS: MacTeX
   - Linux: TeX Live

Create a project structure:

```
math-study/
├── notes/
├── exercises/
├── projects/
└── template.tex
```

Use this `template.tex`:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath, amssymb, graphicx}

\title{Mathematics Study Notes}
\author{Your Name}
\date{}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Topic}

% Content goes here

\end{document}
```

## Curriculum

1. Arithmetic
   - Integers, rationals, reals
   - Basic operations and their properties
   - Fractions, decimals, percentages

2. Algebra
   - Variables and expressions
   - Equations and inequalities
   - Functions: linear, quadratic, exponential

3. Geometry
   - Euclidean geometry basics
   - Areas and volumes
   - Coordinate geometry

4. Trigonometry
   - Right-angled triangles
   - Trigonometric functions
   - Sine and cosine rules

5. Elementary Statistics and Probability
   - Data representation
   - Measures of central tendency and spread
   - Basic probability concepts

## Study Method

For each topic:

1. Read the relevant chapter from the chosen textbook.
2. Create a new LaTeX document in the `notes/` directory.
3. Write concise definitions and important theorems.
4. Work through examples, typing them in LaTeX.
5. Solve exercises, documenting both problems and solutions.
6. Compile your LaTeX document frequently to catch errors early.

Adopt this cycle:

```
read -> understand -> implement in LaTeX -> solve problems -> review
```

## LaTeX Learning

Learn LaTeX alongside mathematics:

1. Start with basic text formatting and sectioning.
2. Progress to mathematical expressions using `amsmath`.
3. Learn to create tables and figures as needed.
4. Gradually incorporate more advanced features like custom macros.

Tip: Learn one new LaTeX feature with each math topic you study.

## Resources

Mathematics texts:
- "Basic Mathematics" by Serge Lang
- "Algebra" by Israel M. Gelfand
- "Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries" by Marvin J. Greenberg

LaTeX resources:
- "The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2ε"
- The TeXbook by Donald Knuth (for deeper understanding)

Online:
- Khan Academy for concept explanations
- Project Euler for mathematical problem-solving practice

## Progress Tracking

Create a `log.md` file:

```markdown
# Study Log

## Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Topic studied: 
- Time spent: 
- Key concepts learned:
- Exercises completed:
- LaTeX features learned:
- Questions/Difficulties:

## Date: YYYY-MM-DD
...
```

Update this log daily. Review weekly to adjust your study plan.

## Projects

Every month, work on a project that combines your math and LaTeX skills:

1. Write a detailed proof of a theorem you've studied.
2. Create a cheat sheet for a completed topic.
3. Develop a set of practice problems with solutions for a specific concept.

Remember: Understanding comes through using the concepts. Type everything in LaTeX, solve many problems, and build a comprehensive personal reference through your notes and projects.
